# 🦜 Echos Network

A more human way to connect with others. Echos is a proximity-based social network built for privacy, real engagement, and creator protection in the age of AI.

### Vision
Echos was born to solve the "death of the social internet". We focus on:
* Real Proximity: An algorithm that prioritizes people you actually know and interact with.
* Creator Shield: Native protection for artists against unauthorized AI training and malicious use of content.
* Ethical Monetization: A clean experience with relevant, non-intrusive ads that value the user's time.
